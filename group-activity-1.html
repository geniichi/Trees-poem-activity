    <h2>Trees</h2>
    <h4> BY JOYCE KILMER</h4>
    <br>
    <!-- This is Walter assigned -->
    <p>
        I think that I shall never see
        A poem lovely as a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
        Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
    </p>

    <!-- This is Meilchu assigned -->
    <p>
        A tree that looks at God all day,
        And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
    </p>


    <!-- This is Rod assigned -->
    <p>
       A tree that may in Summer wear
       A nest of robins in her hair; 
    </p>    
    
    <!-- This is Val assigned -->
    <p>
        Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
        Who intimately lives with rain.
    </p>
    
    <!-- This is Ciprian assigned -->
    <p>Poems are made by fools like me,
       But only God can make a tree.
    </p>
